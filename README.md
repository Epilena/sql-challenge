# SQL-Challenge

Introduction

In this practice, I am the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard.  This is my first major task, a research project on wmployees of the corporation form the 1980's to the 1990's. Six CSV files were combined to create an employees SQL database.  The files contained employee data including employee number, title, name, sex, hire date, assigned department, and salary.  

Methods

ERD of tables was created using quick database diagrams.  Using Postgres the data was analyzed by joining tables and selecting based on different criteria. After analysis in Postgres data was opened in a Jupyter notebook and analyzed using Pandas. A histogram and bar graph were created using Matplotlib.  

Analysis/Results

Some examples of selection criteria and combining of tables in Postrgres:

Once imported into Jupyter, a histogram was created with the most common salary ranges for employees.
